## 1. Dataset Analysis and Preprocessing:
* Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and features. It contains various attributes related to employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, performance ratings, etc., along with a target variable indicating whether an employee has left the company (Yes or No).
* Perform preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

## 2. Model Development:
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Choose suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine) for binary classification.
* Implement the selected algorithm(s) using Python libraries like scikit-learn or pytorch.
* Train the model(s) on the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 3. Model Evaluation and Optimization:
* Analyze the performance of the trained model(s) using evaluation metrics.
* Explore techniques for model optimization, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or model ensemble methods, to improve performance.
* Optimize the model parameters and evaluate the impact on model performance.
